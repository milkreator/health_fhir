# health_fhir
A python package providing some (hopefully) helpful FHIR interfaces to the Tryton data models in GNU Health.

I am subdividing the functionality in the GNU Health FHIR server into different packages, since I am sure other people can better contribute, use, and employ the functionality if given the opportunity.
